## Overview

The purpose of this extension is to allow hands-free reloading of a web browser tab when files monitored by [Feri](https://github.com/nightmode/feri) change. This can greatly speed up the development cycle of local files or even better, files served by a web server you control.

Advanced features like CSS hot reloading and smart reloading are being considered for future versions. If you absolutely need those features today, a more complex browser extension may suit you better.

## Install

For Chrome, install via the `Feri` page on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/feri).

For Firefox, install via the `Feri` page on the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feri/) site.
